# Project Description
The course features a project to help the student’s understanding of applying
the portfolio construction techniques from class to personal and professional
investments.

The objective is to evaluate the performance of a quantitative investment strategy
using common performance evaluation techniques. The quality of the project will
be based on the quality of the analysis, not the performance of the strategy. A
well-executed analysis of a strategy that performs poorly is perfectly acceptable.

## Assignment in Brief
 - You have a “primary strategy” allocated to you for this project.
 - Explain and analyze your primary strategy as an independent stand-alone
investment.
 - Evaluate your primary strategy as part of a diversified portfolio consisting
of a long value-weighted stock market and long value-weighted bond market
portfolio.
 - Report your results using a maximum of 5 pages for all text, figures, and
tables. Code does not count towards the page limit, but you should strive
for succinct and legible code.
