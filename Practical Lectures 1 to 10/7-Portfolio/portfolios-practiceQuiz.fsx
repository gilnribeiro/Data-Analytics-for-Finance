# Some good things to reference

[Anonymous Records](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/language-reference/anonymous-records#syntax). You can read the above link for details, but the point of these is quite simple.

Records have been our main type for holding data for an observation. We've typically defined these ahead of time with a name before using them. This is good for important types that you will use frequently.

If you're using a particular record in only a few lines of code, then it can feel cumbersome to define the type beforehand. Anonymous records are a good solution in these circumstances. They are records that you can essentially use like regular records that we've been using, but you don't have to define the name of the record ahead of time.

I rarely use anonymous records, but you might find them useful for exploratory data manipulation. They're also kind of nice for these short problems because I don't need to define a record for each problem.

# Anonymous records
1. 
- Create a *record* named `ExampleRec` that has an `X` field of type int and a `Y` field of type int. Create an example `ExampleRec` and assign it to a value named `r`.

- Create an *anonymous record* that has an `X` field of type int and a `Y` field of type int. Create an example of the anonymous record and assign it to a value named `ar`.

type ExampleRec = { X : int ; Y : int}
let r = {X = 1 ; Y = 2}
let ar = {| X = 1 ; Y = 2|}

2. Imagine you have this array

```fsharp
open System
type ArExample = { Date : DateTime; Value: float}
let arr = [|{ Date = DateTime(1990,1,1); Value = 1.25}
            { Date = DateTime(1990,1,2); Value = 2.25}
            { Date = DateTime(1991,1,1); Value = 3.25} |]
```
- Group the observations by a tuple of (year,month) and find the 
minimum value for each group. Report the result as a tuple of the group
and the minimum value [so it will be ((year, month), minValue)].
- Now, the same thing with anonymous records.
Group the observations by an Anonymous Record {| Year = year; Month= month|} and find the 
minimum value for each group. Report the result as an Anonymous record with a Group
field for the group and a value field for the minimum value [so it will be
{| Group = {| Year = year; Month= month|}; Value = minValue |}].
