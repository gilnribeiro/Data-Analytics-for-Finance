Problems with the managed volatility strategy:
- Transaction costs
- Taxes

If people have leverage aversion:
- Easy to make mistakes that cause you to go broke
- Depends on the degree of risk aversion

To try to prevent panic stock exchanges have a thing called Circuit Breaker:
- If stock price moves too much and people are panic
- They alt the stock trading altogether for a while

Leverage has an inherent "Getting really broke" risk:
- Eg. imagine if you had leverage on GME because it was low volatility

(The game we are playing iis taht volatility falls faster than expected returns)

Take volatility target (e.g. 15) divide by the VICS and you can see how much you should put in the market
- e.g 20/22 -> 90% market 10% cash simple volatility timming strategy
